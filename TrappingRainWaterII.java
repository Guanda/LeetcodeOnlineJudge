/*
Given an m x n matrix of positive integers representing the height of each unit cell in a 2D elevation map, 
compute the volume of water it is able to trap after raining.

Note:
Both m and n are less than 110. The height of each unit cell is greater than 0 and is less than 20,000.

Example:
Given the following 3x6 height map:
[
  [1,4,3,1,3,2],
  [3,2,1,3,2,4],
  [2,3,3,2,3,1]
]
Return 4.

The above image represents the elevation map [[1,4,3,1,3,2],[3,2,1,3,2,4],[2,3,3,2,3,1]] before the rain.
After the rain, water are trapped between the blocks. The total volume of water trapped is 4.

Analysis:
	Thoughts: same idea as the trap Rain Water I.
	Since this is not 1-way run through a 1D array (2D array can go 4 directions...), need to mark visted spot.
	Use PriorityQueue, sort lowest on top, because the lowest surroundings determines the best we can get.
	Bukkit theory: the lowest bar determines the height of the bukkit water. So, we always process the lowest first. 
	Therefore, we use a min-heap, a natural order priorityqueue based on height.
	Note: when adding a new block into the queue, comparing with the checked origin, we still want to add the higher 
	height into queue. 
	(The high bar will always exist and hold the bukkit.)
	Step:
	1. Create Cell (x,y,h)
	2. Priorityqueue on Cell of all 4 borders
	3. Process each element in queue, and add surrounding blocks into queue.
	4. Mark checked block
